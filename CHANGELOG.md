# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- `flux9s --version` / `-V`: the standard version flag now works (previously
  only the `version` subcommand existed — the Homebrew formula's test block
  has been calling the flag all along).
- `flux9s completions <shell>`: generate shell completions for bash, zsh,
  fish, elvish, and powershell.

### Changed
- Release binaries are now built with fat LTO, a single codegen unit, and
  stripped symbols — noticeably smaller downloads from brew, binstall, and
  GitHub releases.
- Declared a minimum supported Rust version (1.88), enforced by a new CI job.
- The Windows release build is now blocking: a release can no longer ship
  without `flux9s-windows-x86_64.zip` if the Windows build breaks.

### Fixed
- Release-notes automation had been silently failing since 0.9.x (retired
  API model), stamping every release with a literal `\n` fallback entry.
  Fixed the generation and backfilled real notes for 0.8.2–0.10.2; the
  changelog's version compare-links now point at the real repository.
- Opt-in dynamic CRD discovery (#197): with `discoverFluxResources: true`,
  flux9s watches CRDs labeled `app.kubernetes.io/part-of=flux` — the same
  label the Flux Operator's FluxReport reads — and shows their resources
  live: unified list with readiness from standard conditions, `:` commands
  from the CRD's own names and short names, `y`/`d`, filtering, and pulse
  counts. Kinds register and deregister dynamically as CRDs are labeled or
  deleted. Discovered kinds are strictly view-only (mutating operations are
  gated to built-in Flux kinds), built-in CRDs are excluded from discovery,
  and with the flag off (default) no CRD watch runs at all.
- Cluster pulse dashboard (#195): `:pulse` answers "is my GitOps pipeline
  healthy?" at a glance — ready/failed/suspended totals and per-kind counts
  for the current namespace scope, the most recent failures with their
  messages for fast triage, and the FluxReport's distribution, entitlement,
  operator, and sync info alongside live controller pod health. Renders
  instantly from the watch state (no fetch) and updates in real time.
- Workload drill-down (#194): `Enter` on a graph workload group opens the
  workload list; `Enter` on a workload opens its detail — rollout status and
  replica health, containers with images, a pods table (phase, ready,
  restarts, age), and the workload's events. `l` streams a pod's logs
  (directly for a single pod, via a pod submenu otherwise), and Back walks
  the whole chain in reverse: logs → detail → list → graph. Read-only.
- Submenu filtering and paging (#128): `/` filters `:ctx`/`:skin`/`:logs`
  menus with the same keys as the resource list (type to narrow, Enter to
  apply, Esc to cancel), PageUp/PageDown (or Ctrl+f/b) page through long
  menus, and `:` drops straight into command mode.

### Fixed
- Submenu selections no longer scroll below the visible popup: the scroll is
  now reconciled at render time with the popup's actual height instead of a
  hardcoded estimate in the key handler.
- Submenus (and the quit dialog) no longer hardcode black backgrounds or
  low-contrast title colors — they follow the active skin like every other
  overlay, fixing illegible popups across themes.
- `l` now also works from the workload list: it fetches the workload and
  continues straight into its pod logs once loaded — and Back from those
  logs returns to wherever `l` was pressed (list or detail).

## [0.12.0] - 2026-07-14

### Fixed
- Graph view no longer flashes when the focused node is taller than the
  viewport (e.g. a FluxInstance's workload group): the focus auto-scroll now
  pins oversized nodes to their top edge instead of oscillating between
  showing their top and bottom on alternating frames.

### Added
- Graph view downstream discovery for ResourceSet and FluxInstance (#204):
  their `status.inventory` now renders like a Kustomization's — Flux resources
  produced by a ResourceSet become individual navigable nodes, Deployments and
  other workloads get the workload group with live status, and arbitrary kinds
  (Namespaces, CRDs, custom resources) aggregate into the resource group.
- Controller pod log viewer (#192): `:logs` opens a submenu of the discovered
  Flux controller pods (`:logs <pod|prefix>` streams one directly). Logs are
  tailed and followed live in a bounded buffer; scrolling up pauses following
  and `G` jumps back to the newest line; `/` searches the buffer. The stream
  runs only while the view is open.
- ResourceSet step visualization (#193): the detail view of a step-based
  ResourceSet lists its ordered steps with per-step phase (done / applying /
  failed / pending) derived from the status conditions, plus each step's
  resource count, template marker, and timeout.

## [0.11.1] - 2026-07-13

### Fixed
- Restored SOCKS5 proxy support (#202): the `kube/socks5` cargo feature was
  accidentally dropped in a dependency cleanup (#182), so kubeconfigs with
  `proxy-url: socks5://…` failed at startup with `requires the disabled
  feature "kube/socks5"`. Regression tests now build a client through both
  socks5 and http proxy configs so a missing proxy feature fails CI.

## [0.11.0] - 2026-07-06

### Added
- Kubernetes Events support:
  - The describe view (`d`) now ends with a kubectl-style Events section
    showing the resource's recent events (Warnings highlighted; degrades to a
    notice when events are unavailable, e.g. RBAC).
  - New `:events` (alias `:ev`) live events feed for the current namespace
    scope — cluster-wide with `:ns all`. Streams in real time, newest first,
    filterable with `/`; `Enter` jumps to the involved Flux resource. The
    events watcher runs only while the view is open.
- Resource action keys now resolve their target from any view via a single
  `view_target()` resolver: `y`/`d` (and `t`/`g`/`h`/operations for watched
  resources) act on the selected event's involved object in the events feed
  and on the focused node in the graph view — previously these keys only
  worked from the resource list, favorites, and detail views. `y`/`d` work
  for non-Flux objects too (Pods, Deployments, …) via the API fetch path,
  and Back returns to the view you came from (events feed or graph).
- Graph view keyboard navigation: `j`/`k` move a highlighted focus between nodes
  (the view auto-scrolls to keep it visible), `Enter` opens the focused resource's
  detail view, and `Esc` returns to the graph.

### Changed
- Graph connectors are redrawn as consistent fan-outs (trunk → branch above the
  children → drop into each child) using proper box-drawing junctions, and nodes
  sit closer together for a tighter, clearer layout.

### Fixed
- `:all` now returns to the main resource list from the events feed (and stops
  the events watch), instead of only clearing filters while stuck in the view.
- The events feed's "not a watched Flux resource" message now names the
  involved object's namespace and points at `y`/`d`, so namespace-scope
  mismatches are visible instead of just confusing.

### Internal
- New live-cluster regression suite (`tests/live_tests.rs`, all `#[ignore]`d):
  exact assertions against the dev kind clusters' planted fixtures — graph
  inventory, describe events, the operator's step-failure message format, pod
  log streaming, and legacy v1beta2 version-fallback discovery. Run locally
  with `just test-live` after `./scripts/dev-clusters.sh ci`, or via the new
  weekly/dispatch `live-tests.yml` workflow.
- New generic `AsyncTask<K, T>` owns the request/dispatch/poll lifecycle for
  view fetches, replacing the five copy-pasted `*_pending`/`*_fetched`/`*_rx`
  field triplets and their hand-rolled trigger/poll methods.
- YAML/describe fetch requests are now typed `ResourceKey`s instead of
  `"type:namespace:name"` strings, removing the re-parse (and its can't-happen
  error branches) from the main loop.
- The Kubernetes events watcher has an independent lifecycle from the resource
  watchers (started lazily, stopped without a full watcher teardown), and
  survives namespace switches.
- Single source of truth for graph node sizing (`GraphNode::render_width`/
  `render_height`); connector geometry extracted into the testable, `Frame`-free
  `fanout_routes()`.
- Per-view behavior consolidated onto `impl View` helpers (`scroll_offset_mut`,
  `is_list_view`, `is_text_search_view`, `is_nested_view`).
- `:` command handling is now data-driven via `COMMAND_TABLE` with focused
  `cmd_*` handlers, replacing the long string-matching chain in `execute_command`.
