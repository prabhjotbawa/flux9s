## Overview

`flux9s` provides a terminal-based interface for monitoring and managing Flux CD resources, inspired by the excellent [K9s](https://github.com/derailed/k9s) project. It offers real-time monitoring of Flux Custom Resources (CRDs) including Kustomizations, GitRepositories, HelmReleases, and more.

### Features

- **Real-time monitoring** - Watch Flux resources as they change using Kubernetes Watch API
- **K9s-inspired interface** - Familiar navigation and keybindings for K9s users
- **Unified and type-specific views** - View all resources together or filter by type
- **Resource operations** - Suspend, resume, reconcile, and delete Flux resources
- **YAML viewing** - Inspect full resource manifests
- **Graph visualization** - Visualize resource relationships and dependencies (Kustomization, HelmRelease, etc.)
- **Reconciliation history** - View reconciliation history for resources that track it
- **Favorites** - Mark frequently accessed resources for quick access
- **Namespace switching** - Monitor resources across namespaces or cluster-wide
- **Status indicators** - Visual indicators for resource health and suspension state

## Installation

### Homebrew (macOS and Linux)

The easiest way to install on macOS and Linux:

```bash
brew install dgunzy/tap/flux9s
```

Or tap the repository first:

```bash
brew tap dgunzy/tap
brew install flux9s
```

### Pre-built Binaries

#### cargo-binstall

If you have [cargo-binstall](https://github.com/cargo-bins/cargo-binstall) installed:

```bash
cargo binstall flux9s
```

This downloads and installs pre-built binaries without compiling from source.

#### Manual Download

Download pre-built binaries from the [Releases](https://github.com/dgunzy/flux9s/releases) page:

- **Linux (x86_64)**: `flux9s-linux-x86_64.tar.gz`
- **macOS (Intel)**: `flux9s-macos-x86_64.tar.gz`
- **macOS (Apple Silicon)**: `flux9s-macos-aarch64.tar.gz`
- **Windows (x86_64)**: `flux9s-windows-x86_64.zip`

Extract and move the binary to a directory in your `PATH`.

### Compile from Source

#### From Crates.io

```bash
cargo install flux9s
```

#### From Source Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/dgunzy/flux9s.git
cd flux9s
cargo build --release
```

The binary will be available at `target/release/flux9s`.

## Quick Start

1. Ensure you have a Kubernetes cluster with Flux installed
2. Configure your `kubeconfig` to point to your cluster
3. Run `flux9s`

```bash
flux9s
```

By default, `flux9s` watches the `flux-system` namespace. Use `:ns all` to view all namespaces or `:ns <namespace>` to switch to a specific namespace.

> **Note:** `flux9s` launches in readonly mode by default.  
> You can change this with `flux9s config set readOnly false` or toggle it in a session using `:readonly`.

## Usage

### Navigation

- `j` / `k` - Navigate up/down
- `:` - Command mode (e.g., `:kustomization`, `:gitrepository`)
- `Enter` - View resource details
- `/` - Filter resources by name (list views) or search text (YAML/describe/trace views)
- `n` / `N` - Next/previous search match (in text views)
- `Shift+N` / `Shift+A` / `Shift+T` / `Shift+S` - Sort by name/age/type/status (press again to reverse)
- `s` - Suspend resource
- `r` - Resume resource
- `R` - Reconcile resource
- `y` - View resource YAML
- `f` - Toggle favorite
- `g` - View resource graph (Kustomization, HelmRelease, etc.)
- `h` - View reconciliation history
- `t` - Trace ownership chain
- `W` - Reconcile with source (Kustomization, HelmRelease)
- `d` - Describe resource
- `Ctrl+d` - Delete resource (with confirmation)
- `?` - Show/hide help
- `q` / `Esc` - Go back; shows a quit prompt when at the root view
- `Q` - Quit immediately (no prompt)
- `Ctrl+C` / `:q` - Quit (also skips the prompt)

### Commands

- `:ctx <name>` - Switch to a different Kubernetes context
- `:ctx` - Open interactive context selection menu
- `:ns <namespace>` - Switch namespace
- `:ns all` - View all namespaces
- `:favorites` or `:fav` - View favorite resources
- `:skin {skin-name}` - set skin directly
- `:skin` - open interactive theme selection menu with live preview (17 built-in themes + custom)
- `:q` or `:q!` - Quit
- `:help` - Show help

### Resource Views

- **Graph View (`g`)** - Visualize resource relationships and dependencies. Shows upstream sources and downstream managed resources. Move the highlighted focus between nodes with `j`/`k` (the view scrolls to keep it visible), press `Enter` to open the focused resource's detail view, and `Esc` to return to the graph. Supported for Kustomization, HelmRelease, ArtifactGenerator, FluxInstance, and ResourceSet.
- **History View (`h`)** - View reconciliation history for FluxInstance, ResourceSet, Kustomization, and HelmRelease resources.
- **Favorites (`f`)** - Mark resources as favorites for quick access. Use `:favorites` command to view all favorites.

### Terminal Commands

- `flux9s config --help` - Show the config options
- `flux9s config set {KEY} {VALUE}` - set a yaml option with the cli.
- `config set ui.skinReadOnly rose-pine` - set a skin that is in your systems flux9s/skins dir when readonly enabled.
- `flux9s config set connectTimeoutSeconds 15` - set the startup Kubernetes API health-check timeout.
- `flux9s config skins set navy.yaml` - import a skin, validate, set in config.

> **Note:** Not all K9s skins are compatible with flux9s. flux9s skins follow a similar format but may require adjustments to work properly.
